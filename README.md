# Water-Quality-Analysis-PowerBI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes extensive water quality sensor data collected from multiple European countries. Leveraging Power BI, this analysis transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights through data preparation, modeling, and interactive visualization.

## Objectives
- Transform raw sensor data into actionable insights.
- Identify trends and anomalies across various countries.
- Support informed decision-making for environmental sustainability.

## Data Description
- **Dataset Size:** Over 1 million rows, 32 columns
- **Coverage:** European countries, various water bodies (rivers, lakes, groundwater, etc.)
- **Parameters:** Country, water body category, determinands (chemical measures), concentrations (min, max, mean, median), and sample quality details.

## Key Features
- Interactive dashboards showcasing trends and comparisons.
- Detailed visualizations including Water Quality Index (WQI).
- Advanced filtering and drill-through functionalities.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
